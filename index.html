									<h3>Data Analyst,Scientist, and Intern Job Description Analysis</h3>
									<p>Through the use of already publicly available data, and data I obtained through the use of a python web scraper that I coded, I scraped through job listings for relevant positions. I then narrowed my search down to just the job descriptions of said job's and created a pool of key words. I then put this data into a database and created relecant viszulizations on tableua. This project was done to help myself better understand the field, and what skills I should prioritize.<br></h3>

								<h3>Letterboxd Watchlist Randomizer</h3>
								<p>Letterboxd is a movie review application that I use often due to my love of movies. Within this app there is a feature that allows me to add movies to a watchlist for when I need some inspiration on what to watch. After having multiple movie nights where my friends and I cannot pick a movie to watch, I decided to code a randomizer for this watchlist. Coded in python, and using the BeautifulSoup library, I coded a program where you enter your username and it parses through all pages of your watchlist and randomly picks one movie. Below is a video of it in action, but I am currently working on teaching myself front end coding to add to a feature to this website where you can do the same.</p>
